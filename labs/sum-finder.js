/*
    Sum Finder

    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
        - You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
        - Sort the array before returning the indices.

    Constraints:
        - Only one valid answer exists.

    Tip: It is often beneficial to brute force the solution first which we can _then_ optimize.
    Bonus: Can you solve it in less than O(n^2) time complexity?
